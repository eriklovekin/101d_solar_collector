why using clearsky values for DHI, DNI

solar azimuth angle equation 1.6.6

calculate hour angles from given? Aren't hour angles 15 deg/hour away from noon

what values were you getting for sunrise/sunset?
	these only adjust the sunrise and sunset values

step 10 middle which curve did you use?

correction for sunrise increases irradiation?

Total loss coefficient

recalculating Tpm as well as tc1 and Tc2?
	Solve for UL in an inner loop
	Use to iterate on Tpm

check for laminar/turbulent

did you account for collector heating up losses?





critical irradiance:
