		calc T_scin from eps
		Guess m_dot_sc, Tpm, Tc1, Tc2
		while not m_dot_sc, Tpm not converged
			Iterate for UL at Tpm
				update UL, Tc1, Tc2 (as in hw3)
			Using converged UL, recalc m_dot_sc, Tpm
		Using m_dot_sc, calc m_dot_hx, A_hx
		if m_dot_hx < m_dot_sc (check initial assumption)
			break to outermost loop (increase tube number)
		A_hx = max(A_hx)
		recalc eps from A_hx
	Check volume requirement
		if good, dope
		if not, start from the beginning
